# Customer Purchase Prediction using Decision Tree

🎯Task-03 | Prodigy Infotech Internship


# Objective

This project builds a Decision Tree Classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on demographic and behavioral attributes like age, job, marital status, and more.

# Overview

-- Using scikit-learn, this project:

-- Creates a sample dataset (no CSV needed)

-- Encodes categorical values with LabelEncoder

-- Splits the data into training and testing sets

-- Trains a Decision Tree using the entropy criterion

-- Evaluates the model's accuracy and performance

-- Visualizes the decision path as a tree plot



# Sample Data

 -- No CSV or external file is required. All data is embedded in the script using Python dictionaries.

# Example entries include:

-- Age: 25, Job: Student, Marital: Single

-- Balance: 1000, Housing Loan: Yes, Personal Loan: No

# Sample feature columns:

['age', 'job', 'marital', 'education', 'default',
'balance', 'housing', 'loan', 'contact']



# Output

The project outputs:

✅ Model Accuracy (e.g., 66%)

📊 Confusion Matrix

📋 Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-score)

🌳 Visual Decision Tree showing split rules and outcomes



# Libraries Used

-- pandas – data manipulation

-- scikit-learn – model building and evaluation

-- matplotlib – tree visualization

-- LabelEncoder – encoding categorical features



# How to Run

1. Open the .ipynb file in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.

2. Run all code cells sequentially.

3. View printed accuracy, confusion matrix, and tree diagram.


> No external file or data download is required.
